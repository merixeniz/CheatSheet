You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers. Examples include:

- docker image prune to clean up just "dangling" images

- docker system prune will clean up everything

- The big one is usually docker image prune -a which will remove all images you're not using. Use docker system df to see space usage.
